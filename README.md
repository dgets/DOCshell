DOCshell (or ddoc [Damo's version of DOC]) is a shell for the Synchronet
BBS package meant to emulate the experience of vDOC (or DOC in general)
implemented in the BBS family that started with ISCA BBS in the 80s, at
UIowa.

The general goals of this interface are to provide as little overhead
for posting and reading messages as possible.  I'm actually deferring a
little bit to the judgment of some others that've been utilizing this
interface for longer than I.  I prefer the old school BBS days, where
more functionality, and more options, meant more things to explore; this
goal is decidedly different, it is to implement as little distraction
from message text/bases and instant messages to other users as possible.
As such, many Synchronet features will not be implemented until I have a
polished beta, and begin tucking them away where only people comfortable
with the interface will be able to stumble across them.

If you would like to see what this kind of system is all about, you can
find slightly differing versions of the DOC software operating at the
following two sites:

	* ISCA BBS (telnet://bbs.isca.uiowa.edu/)
	* eSchwa BBS (telnet://bbs.eschwa.com/)

Please be aware that, at the very least, eSchwa BBS is run by fascists.

My own BBS (still pending implementation of this DOCish interface [which
will be coming very soon]) can be found at the following addresses:

	* Tinfoil Tetrahedron BBS (telnet://tinfoil.synchro.net/)
	* Tinfoil Tetrahedron BBS (secure via SSH: ssh://tinfoil.synchro.net:8022/)
