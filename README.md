Just a wee bit of a project that I'm working on in order to make my
fully-featured BBS suite a little bit friendlier to the people that I
used to spend a lot of time on text media with.  It probably won't drag
many of them over here, since our other nexii have disappeared, but who
knows.  At the very least it's good experience for me in maintainable
coding and JavaScript (not to mention JS with different custom
libraries).
