# DOCshell/dDoc

DOCshell (or dDoc [Damo's version of DOC]) is a shell for the _Synchronet
BBS_ package meant to emulate the experience of _vDOC_ (or DOC in general),
implemented in the BBS family starting with ISCA BBS in the 80s, at
the University of Iowa.

## Goal and Mission

The general goals of this interface are to provide as little overhead,
for posting and reading messages, as possible.  I'm actually deferring a
little bit to the judgment of some others that've been utilizing this
interface for longer than I.  I prefer the old school BBS days, where
more functionality, and more options, meant more things to explore; this
goal is decidedly different, it is to implement as little distraction
from message text/bases and instant messages to other users as possible.
As such, many Synchronet features will not be implemented until I have a
polished beta, and begin tucking them away where only people comfortable
with the interface will be able to stumble across them.

## Current State

DOCshell/dDoc has hit 'release' state 0.1b, ready for beta testing, as of
29 Jul 15.  Although there are still some minor display issues, I believe 
that all usability features are in place.  Of course, part of beta releasing
this software is testing that hypothesis out.  ;)

## Checking it Out for Yourself

If you would like to see what this kind of system is all about, you can
find slightly differing versions of the DOC software operating at the
following two sites:

	* ISCA BBS (telnet://bbs.isca.uiowa.edu/)
	* eSchwa BBS (telnet://bbs.eschwa.com/)

Please be aware that, at the very least, eSchwa BBS is run by fascists.

## dDoc's Home

My own BBS (still pending implementation of this DOCish interface [which
will be coming very soon]) can be found at the following addresses:

	* Tinfoil Tetrahedron BBS (telnet://tinfoil.synchro.net/)
	* Tinfoil Tetrahedron BBS (secure via SSH: ssh://tinfoil.synchro.net:8022/)
