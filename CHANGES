dmbase.js:

* added return to 's' option @ message read menu, and some other magic
  gunk to get it working properly
* added code to make 'default' case at the read message menu not go into
  an infinite loop
* changed irrelevant code in rcChoice() that was causing infinite loops

ddoc2.js:
* added confine_messagebase boolean constant to ddoc2

ddebug.js: 
* removing due to depreciation and reimplementing messagebase constraint
  code elsewhere

ddoc2.js:
* adding confine_messagebase passing as the final argument to any and
  all messagebase routines

dmbase.js:
* adding testing for that boolean in appropriate methods
* depreciating 'stay_utopian' as it's being passed from constraint
  parameter passing from ddoc2 now
* deleting a big chunk of depreciated and commented out code for ease of
  further development
* fixed 'DystopianUtopia' name being inserted where the message group
  being constrained to should have been accessed by code

* adding a bounce to the dystopian message areas if confinement is set
* working on 'j'ump functionality from the main level prompt/menu
* changing 'Goto' behavior in the new message scan to print sub name
  properly
* realized that 'Goto' behavior is still hosed because it should not
  cycle through everything, but only print the name of the next sub that
  it finds with new messages
